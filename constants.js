        fullDescription: 'After the death of king Seehaan the other 2 rulers started the Great War for his territories. The country was named Eelahtra and soon after the end of the war riots and coups started in the country. A lot of powerful and wealthy people wanted to become kings. After 3 years the big families agreed to work together in secret and decided to start propagating a new way of rulership they called democracy. People really liked the idea of being equal and being able to vote for the person who makes the decisons. The country elected 15 people who would take the most crucial decisons and help employ other suitable candidates in government positions. They soon were named "The Council of 15". Most of its members were from the welthy families but they left 3 spots for other people to show that everyone could become a member of the council. The country was renamed to Gruneda, symbolizing a new and free country. They started mass manipulation and spread false narratives but were really carefully to not look like tyrants. They also had a say in who runs the police and used them as people to do their dirty work. They made Senturion the chef of the police and hid the fact that he is a 3 way Telekai user. In addition to them wanting to control the cash flow of businesses and the whole country they were also secretly developing a machine that could give normal people Telekai. After many failed attempts and researches they finally made a machine that had a 60% chance of giving a normal person Telekai. They named the machine The Accelerator. The subjects that were sucessful were made policeman and everything was a secret. There was even one occassion that they gave a Telekai user second power. He was also working for the police but received special position. The police were one of the best paid jobs in Gruneda. They were specificlly trained to handle dangerous criminals and 2 way Telkai users. To become a policeman you had to go to a special school after 18 years of age. Then if you graduate you are trained in squads of 5 people and you become a policeman. Everyone who became a 2 way Telakai user was considered a criminal and is either killed if he is too dangerous or put in jail(first for murder and second for endangering others). The biggest problem of Gruneda were The Reapers. They were making riots and fake Telekai incidents in order to push their agenda of removing all Telekai from the world. This conflicted the council\'s thirst for power and control. The Reapers and The Nullifiers were the most wanted criminals. A lot of Telekai users became afraid of people because they could lose their powers and jobs. A big majority of the people were for the removal of all Telekai but others were against because they wanted their powers and they could become vulnerable to attacks. Thing really ecalated when The Reapers attacked the capital Balitra to destroy The Accelerators. The news spread fast and the people were pissed at the council. A lot of societies formed that wanted to become an independant country. Gruneda was collapsing. They also lost The Great War and a lot of its people were killed and a lot enslaved. Then both Gruneda and Ashtal were no longer countries their territories were split.'

        fullDescription: "After The Great War the two countries needed a border so invasions and killings are less common. It was named No Man's Land and was left from the world. It remained a territory without laws, protection or funding. Most of people left No Man's Land and went to Gruneda because of the country's more liberal laws. Some people didn't have money to move, some didn't want to leave their birth places and homes. Communities started to form and people were defending their relatives and friends. Most places still remain full of thieves, killers, drug addicts, alchoholics. The biggest formed community formed called themselves Zenia. Its territory is really big and they made their own laws. They protect their land and are really careful who they let in. Beneath Zenia is a Undeground city covering a small portion of it. The Underground city is still a place without laws but it is generally a place to go for organized fights. The most famous one is the close ring fights of Sekutt. They put Therodite on people and made them fight willingly or unwillingly. People can bet on the fighters and then the winners double the bet that is said before the fight as an entry. Not only 1v1 fights were done but also tournaments. There were also animal fights(mostly dogs, but also bears and wolves). In the Undeground city of Zenia Hexamorph met Judiro and they created The Reapers. The Undeground City became later a place were The Reapers were meeting."

        fullDescription: "King Halid who ruled the east territories remained a ruler after The Great War. He decided to name the country Ashtal. For 100 years his family kept the throne. The Alkan family were getting a lot of power. They were wealthy and had strong Telekai users. They were conspiring to kill the king and get his throne. Around this time also the Secret Society Of The 30 Sons emerged. They helped the conspiration against the king without the Alkan family knowing. After the revolution the king was killed and the Alkan family were royalties now. 300 years after that they are still in power and now the new king is Kledance Alkan. He was raised to be an educated smart man, great general and he was also a Telekai user. When he was 11 his parents made him kill his older brother who was close to him eat his hearth and get a second power. Now Kledance is the next in line for the throne and became a king. The 30 Sons extended their reach in the royal family and the king's most trusted councelar is a 3 way Telekai user and leader of the Sons Califf. Kledance's uncle and aunt are also a part of the society, also his head general Byfe and some other generals. The Sons' goal is to take control of Ashtal and the the whole world and spread their world view and power. They were proposing the creatrion of a strong army in case Gruneda wanted to invade them. So they were really careful of who they make a general. There is a group called The Royal Scouts that search for people with good combative Telekai and see if they have a potential for a captain(general) and if they don't possess the qualities they hire them as soldiers. Some of the Royal Scouts are members of the 30 Sons and 3 of his top captains also. That way they are sure things go their way. Also once every 3 years there is a tournament in which the best 3 candidates are recruited as captains. Hexamorph decided that someone from the Reapers should participate and try to get to the king and kill him, creating chaos. The idea is that one of them will bring Hex with them by Biozome's Telekai. They didn't know however that Hex's real plan was to trick his team and put a random person inside the Biozome's tp bug and create a false Gruneda killing of the king. So he tricked Biozome, Alukai and others. When Kledance caught Alukai he then decided that he was a grunedian spy sent to kill him. This was used by Califf and the Sons and they convinced him to attack Gruneda and finally join the 2 countries together as they were in the past. The king accepted and started to prepare the army. He put Therodite on Alukai and sent him to Gothark. They then started preparations for the war. The whole Ashtal army is 200 million soldiers. Kledance decided to leave 50 million to reamin in Ashtal and keep people from rebelling and random attacks. The army consists of 2000 captains. 1700 of them went to war and 300 remained."
